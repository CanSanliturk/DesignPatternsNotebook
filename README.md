# Design Patterns Notebook

You can find examples of SOLID design principles and popular design patterns with implementations and explanations as comments. If you want to compile an example in a directory, run the following command on terminal

```
g++ -std=c++20 -o run.o main.cpp
```

and if you want to run the executable and see the outputs, run

```
./run.o
```
