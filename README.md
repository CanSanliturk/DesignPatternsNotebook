# Design Patterns Notebook

You can find examples of SOLID design principles and popular design patterns with implementations and explanations as comments. If you want to compile an example in a directory, run the following command on terminal, in the directory of the example you want to execute. Note that there are some examples which have multiple .cpp files. For those, do not forget to include them while listing source files.

```
g++ -std=c++20 -o run.o main.cpp /*place other .cpp files here just like main.cpp, excluding comment braces*/
```

and if you want to run the executable and see the outputs, run

```
./run.o
```
