# MOTIVATION

* Complicated objects (cars, phones, etc.) are not designed from scratch. They reiterate existing designs.

* An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype

* We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it. Requires deep copy support. 

* We make the cloning convenient, for example by using a Factory

* Thus, prototype is a partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
