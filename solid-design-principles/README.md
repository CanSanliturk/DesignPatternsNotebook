# SUMMARY

* Single Responsibilty Principle
	* A class should have only one reason to change
	* Seperation of concerns: different classes handling different, independent task/problems

* Open-Closed Principle
	* Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification

* Liskov Substitution Principle
	* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype

* Interface Segregation Principle
	* Don't put too much into an interface, split into seperate interfaces
	* YAGNI: You ain't going to need it

* Dependency Inversion Principle
	* High-level modules should not depend upon low-level ones, use abstractions
