# MOTIVATION

* Balancing complexity and presentation/usability

* Provides a simple, easy to understand/user interface over a large and sophisticated body of code

# SUMMARY

* Build a Facade to provide a simplified API over a set of classes

* May wish to (optionally) expose internals through the facade

* May allow users to escalate to user more complex APIs if they need to
