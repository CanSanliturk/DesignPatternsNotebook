# MOTIVATION

* Getting the interface you want from the interface you have

# Analogy

* Electrical devices have different power (interface) requirements

	* Voltage (5V, 220V)

	* Socket/plug type (Europe, UK, USA)

* We cannot modify our gadgets to support every possible interface

* Thus, we use a special device (an adapter) to give us the interface we require from the interface we have

# DEFINITION

* A construct which adapts an existing interface X to conform to the required interface Y
